# Is Tesla in Retrograde

Retrograde is the apparent procession of a stellar object opposite to other bodies in the system. Astrologers assign
special meaning to this phenomenon, especially with regards to the planet Mercury. As of February 6, 2018, there is a
new celesial of note orbiting the Earth, a Tesla Roadster with a dummy pilot on the ultimate roadtrip through the solar
system. 

From time to time, it too is observed processing in retrograde. This website and API will tell you on any given day if
the roadster is in retrograde.
